## Description
Dungeons and Drawings is a game made in Java during the DBL Interactive Intelligent Systems course at the University of Technology Eindhoven. The game is a puzzle game that asks the player to draw objects to handle their current situation. These drawings are interpreted by a convolutional neural network and if drawn sufficiently, will help the player solve their puzzle.

## Project
The goal of the project was to create a game (interactive intelligent system) in Java.
The requirements included that it had to contain sufficiently advanced computer graphics aspects 
and used artificial intelligence. To this extent, we implemented the following:
- Lighting engine
  - Ambient lighting
  - Directional lights
  - Spot lights
  - Dynamic lighting
- Animation
  - Skeletal animation
  - Keyframed animation
  - Vertex shader morphing
- Convolutional neural network
- A* pathfinding

Here is a [link to the trailer/overview video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CFVY_KCz2ec) of our game.

## Install instructions
Clone this repository and import the maven `pom.xml`. That should be all to get the project running. 
The supported operating systems are the same as for LWJGL:  
- Linux x64
- Linux arm64
- Linux arm32
- macOS x64
- Windows x64
- Windows x86
